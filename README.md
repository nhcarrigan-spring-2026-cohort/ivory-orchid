# Shelter Pet Adoption Board

**“Every pet deserves a home.”**

## Overview

The **Shelter Pet Adoption Board** is a platform designed to help local animal shelters showcase pets available for adoption and connect them with the right adopters.

Each pet has a rich profile that goes beyond basic stats like age or size. We focus on **personality, habits, and special traits** because people don’t fall in love with a checklist — they fall in love with a story.

Our goal is simple:  
**Make it easier for shelters to tell each pet’s story and for adopters to find their perfect match.**
